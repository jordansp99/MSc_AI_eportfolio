### Unit 7

#### Unit 7.1 Summary Measures Worksheet
#### Excercise 1

| Diet | n | Mean | SD |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diet A** | 50 | 5.341 | 2.536 |
| **Diet B** | 50 | 3.710 | 2.769042 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*

The average weight loss for Diet A is significantly higher than that of Diet B. On average, participants on Diet A lost about 1.6 units kgs more than those on Diet B. The Standard Deviations are relatively similar , suggesting that the inconsistency of results is similar between the two groups. However, because Diet B has a lower mean and a slightly higher SD, its results are proportionally less consistent than Diet A. These results suggest that Diet A is superior to Diet B for weight loss, as it produces a higher average reduction in weight with similar variability among participants.

#### Excercise 2

| Statistic | Diet A | Diet B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **n** | 50 | 50 |
| **Mean** | 5.341 | 3.710 |
| **SD** | 2.536 | 2.769 |
| **Median** | 5.569 | 3.745 |
| **Q1** | 3.748 | 1.953 |
| **Q3** | 7.033 | 5.404 |
| **IQR** | 3.285 | 3.451 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*
Diet A produces a consistently higher weight loss across the board. While both diets show similar variability the entire distribution of Diet A is shifted upward. A participant chosen at random from the Diet A group is statistically likely to have lost significantly more weight than a participant from the Diet B group.

#### Excercise 3

| | Area 1 (Freq) | Area 1 (%) | Area 2 (Freq) | Area 2 (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | 11 | 15.7 | 19 | 21.1 |
| **B** | 17 | 24.3 | 30 | 33.3 |
| **Other** | 42 | 60.0 | 41 | 45.6 |
| **Total** | **70** | **100** | **90** | **100** |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?*

Brand B is the preferred major brand in both demographics, consistently outperforming Brand A. However, the two areas show different levels of market penetration: Area 1 is dominated by the "Other" category (60%), indicating a fragmented market where consumers prefer alternatives. In contrast, Area 2 shows stronger engagement with the major labels, where Brand A and Brand B combined capture the majority of the market.

#### Unit 7.2 Hypothesis Testing Worksheet

*Recall that in Exercise 8.4, a two-tailed test was undertaken of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents in Data Set G. Suppose instead a one-tailed test had been conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was the more effective. What would your conclusions have been?*

The conclusion would be even stronger than the two-tailed test. There is highly significant evidence to conclude that Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Filter Agent 2 at reducing impurities. By switching to a one-tailed test, the p-value is halved (from 0.0075 to 0.0038), making the finding of Agent 1's superiority even more statistically significant.
*Consider the bank cardholder data of Data Set C Superplus. Open the Excel workbook Exa8.6C.xlsx which contains this data from the Exercises folder. 
Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete an appropriate test of whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret your findings. What assumptions underpin the validity of your analysis, and how could you validate them?*

I will conduct a one-tailed independent samples t-test.

Null Hypothesis: The mean income of males is less than or equal to that of females.

Alternative Hypothesis: The mean income of males exceeds that of females.

### t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances

| | Males | Females |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean** | 52.91333333 | 44.23333333 |
| **Variance** | 233.128972 | 190.175819 |
| **Observations** | 60 | 60 |
| **Pooled Variance** | 211.652395 | |
| **Hypothesized Mean Difference** | 0 | |
| **df** | 118 | |
| **t Stat** | 3.2679 | |
| **P(T<=t) one-tail** | 0.00070974 | |
| **t Critical one-tail** | 1.65786952 | |
| **P(T<=t) two-tail** | 0.00141947 | |
| **t Critical two-tail** | 1.98027225 | |

Mean Incomes: The average income for males is 52.91 and for females is 44.23.

We reject the null hypothesis. The calculated t-statistic (3.2679) is much larger than the critical value (1.6579). Furthermore, the p-value (0.0007) is significantly less than the standard significance level of 0.05. There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean income for males is significantly higher than the population mean income for females. The results are highly statistically significant (less than a 0.1% chance this difference happened by random coincidence)

Assumption 1: Independence - Each cardholder's income is independent of others. It can be validated by ensuring the data was collected through a random sampling process from the bank's cardholder database.

Assumption 2: Normality - The population incomes for both genders are normally distributed. It can be validated by creating histograms or Q-Q plots for each group to look for a bell-shaped curve. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test can also be used.

Assumption 3: Homogeneity of Variance - The population variances for both groups are equal. Levene’s test for equality of variances. If this assumption were violated, use Welch’s t-test instead.

*Consider the filtration data of Data Set G. Open the Excel workbook Exe 7.4G.xlsx which contains these data from the Exercises folder. Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete a two-tailed test of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents, and interpret your findings.*

Since the measurements for Agent 1 and Agent 2 are recorded for the same 12 batches, the data is paired. Therefore, the appropriate test to use is a t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means.

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the population mean impurity between the two agents

Alternative Hypothesis: The population mean impurity differs between the two agents.

| | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean** | 8.25 | 8.683333333 |
| **Variance** | 1.05909091 | 1.07787879 |
| **Observations** | 12 | 12 |
| **Pearson Correlation** | 0.90105581 | |
| **Hypothesized Mean Difference** | 0 | |
| **df** | 11 | |
| **t Stat** | -3.2639386 | |
| **P(T<=t) one-tail** | 0.003773 | |
| **t Critical one-tail** | 1.79588482 | |
| **P(T<=t) two-tail** | 0.00754599 | |
| **t Critical two-tail** | 2.20098516 | |

Reject the null hypothesis. The absolute value of the t-statistic (3.2639) is greater than the critical value (2.2010). Additionally, the p-value (0.0075) is much smaller than the standard significance level of 0.05 (5%). There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean impurity differs significantly between the two filtration agents

Based on this data, Agent 1 is more effective than Agent 2 because it resulted in a statistically significant lower average impurity level (8.25 vs 8.68).



### Unit 8

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies alongside that for Area 1. 
Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?*
![Brand A vs Brand B vs Other ](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig1.png "Brand A vs Brand B vs Other")
In both demographic areas, Brand B is consistently preferred over Brand A, though "Other" brands represent the largest market share in each location. Area 2 shows significantly higher market penetration for the primary brands, with Brand A and Brand B combined capturing over 50% of the market, whereas Area 1 is much more fragmented with 60% of consumers opting for "Other" brands. This suggests that while Brand B is the leading individual brand in both regions, Area 2 consumers are more inclined toward established brands, while Area 1 presents a more competitive landscape dominated by a wider variety of alternative choices.

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.2E.xlsx from the Example folder. This contains the frequency distributions for Data Set E Heather (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart showing the heather species prevalence in the two different locations. Briefly interpret your findings.*

![Location A vs Location B](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig2.png "Location A vs Location B")
Contrast in heather species prevalence between the two sites, showing that Location A supports a much denser population than Location B. In Location A, heather is predominantly "Abundant" and rarely "Absent", whereas Location B is most frequently characterised by the species being "Absent". While "Sparse" levels are relatively comparable across both sites, the high percentage of "Abundant" classifications in Location A versus the high percentage of "Absent" classifications in Location B indicates that Location A is a significantly more favorable habitat for heather.

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 8.3 together with some of the Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above example. 
Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for each of the two diets?*

![Diet A vs Diet B](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig3.png "Diet A vs Diet B")
Diet A is generally more effective, as its distribution is shifted toward higher weight loss compared to Diet B. While Diet B peaks at a loss of 2–4 kg, Diet A peaks at 4–8 kg, indicating that a significantly larger proportion of participants achieve greater weight loss results on Diet A.

![PowerBI Data Visualisation](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig4.png "PowerBI Data Visualisation")
Using the Microsoft Financial Sample dataset, I developed a Sales Performance Dashboard in Power BI. I implemented KPI cards at the top to provide an immediate summary of critical business metrics: Total Sales. To analysee performance over time, I created a line chart tracking 'Sum of Sales by Month,' which reveals a significant revenue peak in October. Finally, I added a donut chart to break down profit by business segment, clearly demonstrating that the Government sector is the company’s primary driver of profitability. This report effectively transforms raw financial data into a visual story that tracks both seasonal growth and segment-specific success.

Coming from a background of data visualisation using Python (Matplotlib) and R, I am used to building charts through precise lines of code and syntax. Using Power BI for the first time has been useful to learn visualisation in a "low-code" environment, where the focus moves from script-writing to drag-and-drop design. I'm glad I have this new tool in my repertoire; it allows for rapid prototyping and the creation of highly interactive dashboards that would take significantly longer to hard-code, ultimately making the data more accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
