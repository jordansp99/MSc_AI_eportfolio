### Unit 7

#### Unit 7.1 Summary Measures Worksheet
#### Excercise 1

| Diet | n | Mean | SD |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diet A** | 50 | 5.341 | 2.536 |
| **Diet B** | 50 | 3.710 | 2.769042 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*

The average weight loss for Diet A is significantly higher than that of Diet B. On average, participants on Diet A lost about 1.6 units kgs more than those on Diet B. The Standard Deviations are relatively similar , suggesting that the inconsistency of results is similar between the two groups. However, because Diet B has a lower mean and a slightly higher SD, its results are proportionally less consistent than Diet A. These results suggest that Diet A is superior to Diet B for weight loss, as it produces a higher average reduction in weight with similar variability among participants.

#### Excercise 2

| Statistic | Diet A | Diet B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **n** | 50 | 50 |
| **Mean** | 5.341 | 3.710 |
| **SD** | 2.536 | 2.769 |
| **Median** | 5.569 | 3.745 |
| **Q1** | 3.748 | 1.953 |
| **Q3** | 7.033 | 5.404 |
| **IQR** | 3.285 | 3.451 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*
Diet A produces a consistently higher weight loss across the board. While both diets show similar variability the entire distribution of Diet A is shifted upward. A participant chosen at random from the Diet A group is statistically likely to have lost significantly more weight than a participant from the Diet B group.

#### Excercise 3

| Brand | Frequency (Area 2) | Percentage (Area 2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | 19 | 21.1 |
| **B** | 30 | 33.3 |
| **Other** | 41 | 45.6 |
| **Total** | 90 | 100 |

Brand B is the preferred major brand in both demographics, consistently outperforming Brand A. However, the two areas show different levels of market penetration: Area 1 is dominated by the "Other" category (60%), indicating a fragmented market where consumers prefer alternatives. In contrast, Area 2 shows stronger engagement with the major labels, where Brand A and Brand B combined capture the majority of the market.
