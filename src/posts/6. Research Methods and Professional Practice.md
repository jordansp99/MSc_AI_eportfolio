### Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods, Scientific Investigation, and Ethics in Computing

In this unit, I learned about the scientific method, specifically the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning, and explored the ethical and professional standards required to conduct responsible and legal research in the computing field.


#### Discusssion 1 Intial Post

The AllTogether case demonstrates failures in professional ethics when releasing software with known accessibility defects. The company violated ACM Principle 1.1 (contributing to societal wellbeing) and Principle 2.3 (respecting existing professional rules) by deploying features that excluded disabled users despite having established accessibility policies (Association for Computing Machinery., 2018). This created legal risks, as non-conformance with WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.1.1 exposes both AllTogether and their customers to potential disability discrimination claims under legislation like the ADA.

The hidden controls excluded keyboard-only users, screen reader users, and individuals with cognitive or motor impairments, demonstrating how technical decisions have implications when accessibility is treated as an afterthought rather than a core requirement (Lazar et al., 2015).

When comparing the ACM Code to the BCS Code of Conduct, both frameworks share fundamental principles around public welfare and non-discrimination. The BCS Code mandates members "have due regard for public health, privacy, security and wellbeing of others" (BCS, 2022, Section 1a) and "conduct professional activities without discrimination" (Section 1c). AllTogether's leadership violated these tenets by prioritising launch schedules over accessibility. The BCS Code also requires members to "only undertake work within professional competence" (Section 2a). Had the team followed this guidance, accessibility requirements would have been integrated from the design phase.

Leadership's question "How many blind people use our product, anyway?" reveals discriminatory attitudes incompatible with professional standards in either framework. Both codes establish that computing professionals must proactively prevent discrimination rather than reactively accommodate after deployment (Mäkipää & Naarmala, 2024)

### Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal

In this unit, I learned how to transform broad research ideas into focused research questions and understood the essential components of a formal research proposal. I now understand how to conduct a critical literature review to identify existing knowledge, theories, and gaps within my chosen area of investigation.

#### Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods

In this unit, I learned about exploratory and descriptive research designs and the three main research methods: quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. I now understand how underlying philosophical assumptions shape a study and how to distinguish between primary and secondary data collection methods to suit my research area.


#### Discusssion 1 Summary Post
[Summary Post Link](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=333848)

My initial post examined how the AllTogether case exemplified failures in professional ethics through violations of both ACM and BCS codes regarding accessibility. I highlighted how deploying features with known defects that excluded disabled users breached fundamental principles around societal wellbeing, non-discrimination, and professional competence, whilst exposing the organisation to legal risks under the ADA and WCAG 2.1.

David's introduction of "ethics-by-design" (Stahl, Timmermans and Mittelstadt, 2016) was particularly valuable, reinforcing that accessibility must be including throughout the development lifecycle rather than treated as a compliance checkbox. The concept of organisational ableism highlighted by Zallio and Clarkson (2022) effectively shows how discriminatory attitudes become institutionalised within corporate culture, making ethical violations systemic rather than isolated incidents.

Tasnika raised an important practical consideration: how can organisations implement meaningful change? Training programmes focused on accessibility standards represent one avenue, but as Tasnika noted, establishing robust user feedback mechanisms during design and development phases is equally important. This proactive engagement with user needs aligns with both ACM and BCS principles of public welfare and non-discrimination.

Rayyan's point that "technology should break down barriers, not add to them" captures the fundamental responsibility of computing professionals. This discussion has reinforced that professional codes are not merely aspirational documents but should be practical frameworks requiring active implementation.

The AllTogether case ultimately demonstrates that accessibility failures stem from organisational culture and leadership priorities. The computing profession must recognise that inclusive design is inseparable from professional competence and ethical practice. As we've collectively identified, professionalism means designing for everyone from the outset, not retroactively including accessibility after marginalising vulnerable users.

#### Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations

In this unit, I learned about various data collection techniques, including case studies, focus groups, and observational methods, and I now understand their specific advantages and drawbacks in gathering both qualitative insights and quantitative data for research.

#### Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design

In this unit, I learned about the practical application of interviews and surveys, specifically the distinction between a survey process and a questionnaire instrument. I now understand how to design effective open and closed questions and how to use pre- and post-testing to provide a "before-and-after" analysis of research implementations.


#### Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

In this unit, I learned about the fundamentals of quantitative methods, specifically how to identify different levels of measurement and use descriptive statistics, such as measures of location and spread, to summarise and interpret numerical data sets.

#### Discussion 2 Initial Post

[Initial Post Link](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=338816#p672768)

Abi’s deliberate selection of only the correlations that portray “Whizzz” favourably, while ignoring evidence of harm, exemplifies what Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn (2011) describe as p-hacking or “researcher degrees of freedom.” Their work demonstrates that undisclosed flexibility in data analysis can make purely spurious findings appear statistically significant, thereby misleading stakeholders and the public. By selectively reporting only the analyses that “work,” Abi is not merely using statistics creatively, he is engaging in a practice known to inflate false-positive rates and distort scientific conclusions.

Under the Royal Statistical Society’s Code of Conduct (2014), statisticians have an “overriding responsibility to the public good,” which includes safeguarding public health. This obligation supersedes loyalty to employers or clients. Therefore, Abi is ethically required to present the full analytical picture, the adverse health signals as well as any positive correlations. Withholding negative findings is a misrepresentation of the data and a direct breach of professional integrity.

Beyond analysis, Abi bears responsibility for the potential misuse of his work; he cannot ethically facilitate deception that endangers public safety. Legally, concealing health risks could invite liability for negligence, while socially, it erodes public trust in research. Should the manufacturer suppress the negative findings, Abi should escalate by documenting his objections and considering whistleblowing, a step often protected by legislation such as the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (Home Office, 2025).

#### Unit 7.1 Summary Measures Worksheet
#### Excercise 1

| Diet | n | Mean | SD |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Diet A** | 50 | 5.341 | 2.536 |
| **Diet B** | 50 | 3.710 | 2.769042 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*

The average weight loss for Diet A is significantly higher than that of Diet B. On average, participants on Diet A lost about 1.6 units kgs more than those on Diet B. The Standard Deviations are relatively similar , suggesting that the inconsistency of results is similar between the two groups. However, because Diet B has a lower mean and a slightly higher SD, its results are proportionally less consistent than Diet A. These results suggest that Diet A is superior to Diet B for weight loss, as it produces a higher average reduction in weight with similar variability among participants.

#### Excercise 2

| Statistic | Diet A | Diet B |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **n** | 50 | 50 |
| **Mean** | 5.341 | 3.710 |
| **SD** | 2.536 | 2.769 |
| **Median** | 5.569 | 3.745 |
| **Q1** | 3.748 | 1.953 |
| **Q3** | 7.033 | 5.404 |
| **IQR** | 3.285 | 3.451 |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the relative effectiveness of the two weight-reducing diets?*
Diet A produces a consistently higher weight loss across the board. While both diets show similar variability the entire distribution of Diet A is shifted upward. A participant chosen at random from the Diet A group is statistically likely to have lost significantly more weight than a participant from the Diet B group.

#### Excercise 3

| | Area 1 (Freq) | Area 1 (%) | Area 2 (Freq) | Area 2 (%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A** | 11 | 15.7 | 19 | 21.1 |
| **B** | 17 | 24.3 | 30 | 33.3 |
| **Other** | 42 | 60.0 | 41 | 45.6 |
| **Total** | **70** | **100** | **90** | **100** |

*Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?*

Brand B is the preferred major brand in both demographics, consistently outperforming Brand A. However, the two areas show different levels of market penetration: Area 1 is dominated by the "Other" category (60%), indicating a fragmented market where consumers prefer alternatives. In contrast, Area 2 shows stronger engagement with the major labels, where Brand A and Brand B combined capture the majority of the market.

#### Unit 7.2 Hypothesis Testing Worksheet

*Recall that in Exercise 8.4, a two-tailed test was undertaken of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents in Data Set G. Suppose instead a one-tailed test had been conducted to determine whether Filter Agent 1 was the more effective. What would your conclusions have been?*

The conclusion would be even stronger than the two-tailed test. There is highly significant evidence to conclude that Filter Agent 1 is more effective than Filter Agent 2 at reducing impurities. By switching to a one-tailed test, the p-value is halved (from 0.0075 to 0.0038), making the finding of Agent 1's superiority even more statistically significant.
*Consider the bank cardholder data of Data Set C Superplus. Open the Excel workbook Exa8.6C.xlsx which contains this data from the Exercises folder. 
Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete an appropriate test of whether the population mean income for males exceeds that of females and interpret your findings. What assumptions underpin the validity of your analysis, and how could you validate them?*

I will conduct a one-tailed independent samples t-test.

Null Hypothesis: The mean income of males is less than or equal to that of females.

Alternative Hypothesis: The mean income of males exceeds that of females.

### t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances

| | Males | Females |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean** | 52.91333333 | 44.23333333 |
| **Variance** | 233.128972 | 190.175819 |
| **Observations** | 60 | 60 |
| **Pooled Variance** | 211.652395 | |
| **Hypothesized Mean Difference** | 0 | |
| **df** | 118 | |
| **t Stat** | 3.2679 | |
| **P(T<=t) one-tail** | 0.00070974 | |
| **t Critical one-tail** | 1.65786952 | |
| **P(T<=t) two-tail** | 0.00141947 | |
| **t Critical two-tail** | 1.98027225 | |

Mean Incomes: The average income for males is 52.91 and for females is 44.23.

We reject the null hypothesis. The calculated t-statistic (3.2679) is much larger than the critical value (1.6579). Furthermore, the p-value (0.0007) is significantly less than the standard significance level of 0.05. There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean income for males is significantly higher than the population mean income for females. The results are highly statistically significant (less than a 0.1% chance this difference happened by random coincidence)

Assumption 1: Independence - Each cardholder's income is independent of others. It can be validated by ensuring the data was collected through a random sampling process from the bank's cardholder database.

Assumption 2: Normality - The population incomes for both genders are normally distributed. It can be validated by creating histograms or Q-Q plots for each group to look for a bell-shaped curve. Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test can also be used.

Assumption 3: Homogeneity of Variance - The population variances for both groups are equal. Levene’s test for equality of variances. If this assumption were violated, I would use Welch’s t-test instead.

*Consider the filtration data of Data Set G. Open the Excel workbook Exe 7.4G.xlsx which contains these data from the Exercises folder. Assuming the data to be suitably distributed, complete a two-tailed test of whether the population mean impurity differs between the two filtration agents, and interpret your findings.*

Since the measurements for Agent 1 and Agent 2 are recorded for the same 12 batches, the data is paired. Therefore, the appropriate test to use is a t-Test: Paired Two Sample for Means.

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in the population mean impurity between the two agents

Alternative Hypothesis: The population mean impurity differs between the two agents.

| | Agent 1 | Agent 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mean** | 8.25 | 8.683333333 |
| **Variance** | 1.05909091 | 1.07787879 |
| **Observations** | 12 | 12 |
| **Pearson Correlation** | 0.90105581 | |
| **Hypothesized Mean Difference** | 0 | |
| **df** | 11 | |
| **t Stat** | -3.2639386 | |
| **P(T<=t) one-tail** | 0.003773 | |
| **t Critical one-tail** | 1.79588482 | |
| **P(T<=t) two-tail** | 0.00754599 | |
| **t Critical two-tail** | 2.20098516 | |

Reject the null hypothesis. The absolute value of the t-statistic (3.2639) is greater than the critical value (2.2010). Additionally, the p-value (0.0075) is much smaller than the standard significance level of 0.05 (5%). There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean impurity differs significantly between the two filtration agents

Based on this data, Agent 1 is more effective than Agent 2 because it resulted in a statistically significant lower average impurity level (8.25 vs 8.68).



### Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualisation

In this unit, I learned about the distinct approaches to qualitative and quantitative data analysis, including techniques like coding for non-numerical data and the use of dashboards for Business Intelligence. I now understand how to select effective visualisation tools and apply critical thinking to communicate research findings accurately and without bias.

#### Discussion 2 Summary Post

[Summary Post Link](https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=340383#p676722)

The discussion surrounding the case of Abi and the "Whizzz" product has provided a comprehensive examination of the tension between corporate interests and professional statistical ethics. My initial post argued that Abi’s selective reporting constitutes a misuse of “research degrees of freedom,” effectively masking potential harm through p-hacking (Simmons, Nelson and Simonsohn, 2011). The dialogue with my peers explored the system nature of these pressures and identified proactive frameworks to prevent unethical practices.

A significant theme emerged regarding the expansion of professional obligations. While I initially focussed on the Royal Statistical Society’s (2014) mandate to prioritise the public good, the inclusion of the ACM Code of Ethics (2025) by my peer, David, reinforced the idea that transparency is a mandatory professional requirement regardless of employer pressure. David also provided context by noting that Abi’s dilemma is often a systemic issue rather than purely individual misconduct, citing evidence that selective reporting remains widespread across various research environments (Xie, Wang and Kong, 2021). This suggest that while Abi’s actions are ethically indefensible, they are symptomatic of broader industry challenges (Rizinski et al., 2022).

The discussion also moved beyond reactive measures, such as my suggestion of whistleblowing under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 (Home Office, 2025). My peer, Tasnika introduced the concept of "the preregistration revolution," suggesting that the use of public data repositories and pre-defined analysis plans could safeguard against selective reporting before it occurs (Nosek et al., 2018). Furthermore, the integration of the American Statistical Association’s (2016) guidelines during the peer response phase solidified the consensus that a statistician’s primary loyalty must remain with the integrity of the data and the safety of the public.

In conclusion, the dialogue has clarified that ethical statistical practice is not merely about technical accuracy, but about the total disclosure of analytical choices. By combining rigorous adherence to professional codes with proactive transparency measures like pre-registration, researchers can better navigate the complex pressures of industry-sponsored research while upholding their responsibility to the public.

#### Charts Worksheet and Analysis

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.1D.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the percentage frequencies together with the bar chart just created in the above example. Add a percentage frequency bar chart showing the brand preferences in Area 2, using the same format as that employed for the Area1 results in the above example. Drag your new chart so that it lies alongside that for Area 1. 
Briefly interpret your findings. What do these results tell you about the patterns of brand preferences for each of the two demographic areas?*

![Brand A vs Brand B vs Other ](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig1.png "Brand A vs Brand B vs Other")

In both demographic areas, Brand B is consistently preferred over Brand A, though "Other" brands represent the largest market share in each location. Area 2 shows significantly higher market penetration for the primary brands, with Brand A and Brand B combined capturing over 50% of the market, whereas Area 1 is much more fragmented with 60% of consumers opting for "Other" brands. This suggests that while Brand B is the leading individual brand in both regions, Area 2 consumers are more inclined toward established brands, while Area 1 presents a more competitive landscape dominated by a wider variety of alternative choices.

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.2E.xlsx from the Example folder. This contains the frequency distributions for Data Set E Heather (see the Data Annexe) to which has been added the corresponding percentage frequency distributions. Complete a percentage frequency clustered column bar chart showing the heather species prevalence in the two different locations. Briefly interpret your findings.*

![Location A vs Location B](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig2.png "Location A vs Location B")

Contrast in heather species prevalence between the two sites, showing that Location A supports a much denser population than Location B. In Location A, heather is predominantly "Abundant" and rarely "Absent", whereas Location B is most frequently characterised by the species being "Absent". While "Sparse" levels are relatively comparable across both sites, the high percentage of "Abundant" classifications in Location A versus the high percentage of "Absent" classifications in Location B indicates that Location A is a significantly more favorable habitat for heather.

*Open the Excel workbook in Exe 8.3B.xlsx from the Exercises folder. This contains the relative frequency histogram for the Diet A weight loss produced in Example 8.3 together with some of the Diet B weight loss summary statistics. Add a relative frequency histogram of the weight loss for Diet B, where possible using the same classes as those employed for the Diet A results in the above example. 
Briefly interpret your histogram. What do these results tell you about the patterns of weight loss for each of the two diets?*

![Diet A vs Diet B](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig3.png "Diet A vs Diet B")
Diet A is generally more effective, as its distribution is shifted toward higher weight loss compared to Diet B. While Diet B peaks at a loss of 2–4 kg, Diet A peaks at 4–8 kg, indicating that a significantly larger proportion of participants achieve greater weight loss results on Diet A.

### Unit 9 - Validity and Generalisability in Research

In this unit, I learned about the concepts of validity, reliability, and generalisability, and how to prepare, cleanse, and visualise research data using tools like PowerBI.

![Page 1](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig4.png "page 1")
![Page 2](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig5.png "page 2")
![Page 3](/MSc_AI_eportfolio/images/research_methods/fig6.png "page 3")

Coming from a background of data visualisation using Python (Matplotlib) and R, I am used to building charts through precise lines of code and syntax. Using Power BI for the first time has been useful to learn visualisation in a "low-code" environment, where the focus moves from script-writing to drag-and-drop design. I'm glad I have this new tool in my repertoire; it allows for rapid prototyping and the creation of highly interactive dashboards that would take significantly longer to hard-code, ultimately making the data more accessible to non-technical stakeholders.



#### Unit 9: Validity and Generalisability in Research
In this unit, I learned the vital importance of reliability, validity, and generalisability in research design, and I gained practical experience in data cleansing and business visualisation using PowerBI.

#### Unit 10: Research Writing
In this unit, I learned about research writing as a vital skill for communicating technical knowledge, specifically understanding how to structure a dissertation and the key requirements for producing a formal, audio-narrated research proposal presentation.

### **SWOT Analysis**

**Strengths**

- Deep understanding of professional codes (ACM, BCS, RSS) and the ability to apply them to case studies.
- Strong ability to perform and interpret inferential statistics (t-tests, p-values, hypothesis testing).
- Proven ability to identify systemic issues like "p-hacking" or "organisational ableism" in technical environments.
- Successfully adapted to use tools such as Power BI.

**Weaknesses**

- Limited evidence of managing a full project lifecycle or risk register in a professional setting.
- Currently at a "Trained" level for Git; requires more advanced usage (branching strategies, advanced CI/CD integration).
- Awareness of legal frameworks (GDPR/PIDA), but less evidence of hands-on security/privacy implementation.

**Opportunities**
- Opportunity to lead in "Ethics-by-Design" for AI systems.
- 
**Threats**
- Relying on secondary datasets carries risks of inherited bias if not properly validated.
- Risk of corporate priorities clashing with ethical statistical practices
