###  Unit 1-3 Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent Based Systems

**Discussion 1 Initial Post**

The popularity of agent-based systems in both academic research and organisational application can be attributed to their transformative capabilities that extend far beyond traditional automation. These autonomous AI agents can independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, learn from experience, and execute multi-step actions without continuous human oversight (Negnevitsky, 2025). This high degree of autonomy, adaptability, and real-time reasoning enables them to effectively automate complex, dynamic, and often ambiguous real-world tasks, leading to significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across diverse sectors such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and scientific discovery (Negnevitsky, 2025). Each agent within these systems is designed with specific attributes and follows rules that dictate its behavioural mechanisms, enabling it to dynamically react to its environment and refine its operations over time (Waldherr et al., 2021). The system's overall behaviour, or "macro phenomena," thus emerges from these individual "micro processes" and their interactions, rather than being explicitly programmed (Waldherr et al., 2021). This bottom-up, emergent approach stands in sharp contrast to traditional statistical methods, which often rely on assumptions like the independence of units or linear relationships, and frequently prove inadequate for analysing complex, interconnected systems with nonlinear dynamics (Waldherr et al., 2021).
The capabilities of autonomous AI agents, translate into tangible benefits for organisations. By capitalising on their ability to independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, and execute multi-step actions, organisations can achieve levels of operational efficiency and automation in tasks that were previously too complex or dynamic for traditional systems. Key applications include simulating flows like traffic and crowd evacuation, analysing market dynamics such as stock markets and e-commerce, modelling organisational behaviour for risk management and design, and understanding diffusion processes in social networks (Bonabeau, 2002)

**Discussion 1 Summary Post**

Our discussion began by highlighting how the transformative power of agent-based systems stems from their unique ability to have autonomous agents that can independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, learn from experience, and execute multi-step actions without continuous human oversight (Negnevitsky, 2025). We established that their bottom-up, emergent behaviour, where complex "macro phenomena" arise from simple "micro-level" agent interactions, stands in sharp contrast to traditional statistical methods that are often inadequate for analysing complex systems with non-linear dynamics (Waldherr et al., 2021).

Elias provided a compelling extension to this, linking these capabilities directly to organisational resilience, particularly in environments with high uncertainty. He noted that the decentralised nature of these systems allows them to adapt to disruptions without the bottlenecks of centralised control, a concept supported by Jennings and Bussmann (2003). He used an example of supply chain logistics, suggesting how agents could "adjust routes or priorities on the fly when unexpected events occur," a capability that could be used in places like Amazon warehouses to increase profitability and reduce manual labour. Furthermore, he reinforced the importance of learning mechanisms, which allow agents to improve over time and deliver long-term gains that "static rule-based agents cannot match."

While we focused on the benefits, Mohamed raised the important issue of managing the vulnerabilities inherent in these emergent systems. He correctly pointed out that the very unpredictability that makes them powerful necessitates robust governance. To achieve this, he proposed a framework for responsible deployment. He began by advocating for robust simulation testing under extreme and edge-case conditions to expose vulnerabilities in agent interactions before they can cause real-world harm. Furthermore, he emphasised the need for multi-layered, human-in-the-loop fail-safes where operators can "pause, override, or reconfigure agents" to maintain essential control in critical domains like public safety. Building on this, he highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring, since adapting agents require ongoing analysis of both micro-level behaviours and macro-level system outcomes to enable early detection of undesirable patterns like "coordination failures or harmful emergent dynamics." Finally, he called for creating auditability standards to ensure that system inputs, decision logic, and interactions can be traced, a measure that supports both troubleshooting and regulatory compliance.

### Unit 5-7 -- Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages

**Initial post**

Agent Communication Languages represent a sophisticated approach to inter-agent communication, distinguishing themselves from lower-level APIs by encoding "speech acts" such as "tell," "ask," or "achieve." This design often separates the transport layer, content language, and ontology, enabling multiple agents to negotiate, advertise capabilities, request services, and coordinate their actions in a declarative manner (Mayfield, Labrou, & Finin, 1996).

A primary advantage of using an ACL like KQML is its high level of abstraction and inherent platform independence. This architecture allows for seamless interoperability among agents developed using different programming languages and operating on different platforms, provided they adhere to the specified ACL protocols (Kone, Shimazu & Nakajima, 2000). This flexibility is particularly valuable in open, evolving environments where participants might not have been initially designed to collaborate.

However, ACLs also bring disadvantages. First, they are complex: to interpret a message correctly, agents often need to share a common ontology. Without this, messages could be misunderstood. Second, KQML and similar ACLs historically lacked fully formalised rules for how each performative should be interpreted, which sometimes caused different implementations to behave inconsistently. Finally, parsing and interpreting ACL messages takes more computing time than a straightforward function call, which can be a disadvantage when efficiency is critical. (Labrou, Finin & Peng,1999)

In contrast, method invocation in programming languages such as Python or Java is much simpler. The benefits are speed, clarity, and strong guarantees about the structure of inputs and outputs. But these calls are tightly coupled: both sides must know the same method definitions, interfaces, and data structures in advance. They are less flexible than ACLs when working in open, evolving environments where participants may not have been designed to cooperate.

**Summary Response**

In my initial post, I aimed to frame the debate around what I see as a central design choice in multi-agent systems: the trade-off between the high-level, declarative flexibility of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) and the efficient, tightly coupled nature of direct method invocation. I highlighted the key challenges that often make developers hesitant to adopt ACLs, namely the need for shared ontologies (a common dictionary), the risk of semantic ambiguity where messages can be misinterpreted, and the performance overhead compared to simple function calls.

Pëllumb, your response directly addressed the most critical of these issues, ontology dependence, which I'm glad you focused on. You provided a compelling, modern perspective that suggests we are no longer constrained by the old limitations. By presenting solutions like dynamic ontology negotiation and the emerging use of Large Language Models for real-time semantic alignment, you rightly showed that this isn't a static problem. This suggests a promising path to overcoming one of the most significant barriers to ACL adoption, allowing agents to effectively communicate in truly open and heterogeneous environments where pre-agreed standards are impossible.

Abdullah, you then grounded the discussion perfectly with a set of practical, engineering-focused strategies to mitigate the very failure modes I outlined. Your recommendations provide a tangible roadmap for building robust and reliable systems. For instance, creating a "message cookbook" and codifying conversation protocols directly tackles the ambiguity I mentioned, while using a directory for capability discovery helps agents operate with more certainty. I found your idea of a hybrid system especially smart. Using the flexible ACL for general coordination and command but switching to a faster, direct connection for sending large amounts of data is an elegant solution. It directly resolves the performance tension I initially raised, effectively giving us the best of both worlds.

Ultimately, your contributions have beautifully demonstrated that the choice is not as drastic as I first presented it. By combining the disciplined architectural patterns Abdullah described with the advanced, adaptive techniques Pëllumb highlighted, we can engineer systems that are both flexible and efficient, overcoming the classic limitations of ACLs.

### Unit 6

In Unit the task was to create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).

Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.

Alice initiates the conversation by sending an ask-all performative. This signals that she is expecting a complete list of all instances that satisfy the condition in the content. The KIF expression asks for all entities ?t that are a tv with a size of 50 inches, and it requests the stock-level (?level) for each of them.

```KQML
(ask-all
  :sender Alice
  :receiver Bob
  :language KIF
  :ontology warehouse-stock
  :reply-with q1
  :content (and
              (tv ?t)
              (size ?t 50-inch)
              (stock-level ?t ?level))
)
```
Bob processes the query and responds with a tell performative. The content of the message is a KIF expression containing a set of facts. Each fact links a specific television model (e.g., model-xyz-100) to its stock level. This response provides Alice with a comprehensive list of all the 50-inch televisions available in the warehouse.
```KQML
(tell
  :sender Bob
  :receiver Alice
  :language KIF
  :ontology warehouse-stock
  :in-reply-to q1
  :content (set
              (and (tv model-xyz-100) (size model-xyz-100 50-inch) (stock-level model-xyz-100 85))
              (and (tv model-abc-200) (size model-abc-200 50-inch) (stock-level model-abc-200 65)))
)
```

Now that Alice has the model numbers and stock levels, she sends another ask-all query to get more detailed product specifications. This time, the KIF content asks for the hdmi-slots for each of the specific television models (model-xyz-100 and model-abc-200) that Bob previously mentioned.
```KQML
(ask-all
  :sender Alice
  :receiver Bob
  :language KIF
  :ontology product-features
  :reply-with q2
  :content (and
              (or (= ?t model-xyz-100) (= ?t model-abc-200))
              (hdmi-slots ?t ?slots))
)
```
Bob responds with a final tell performative, providing the specific feature information Alice requested. The KIF content explicitly states the number of HDMI slots for both model-xyz-100 and model-abc-200.
```KQML
(tell
  :sender Bob
  :receiver Alice
  :language KIF
  :ontology product-features
  :in-reply-to q2
  :content (set
              (and (tv model-xyz-100) (hdmi-slots model-xyz-100 4))
              (and (tv model-abc-200) (hdmi-slots model-abc-200 3)))
)
```
