###  Unit 1-3 Collaborative Discussion 1: Agent Based Systems

**Discussion 1 Initial Post**

The popularity of agent-based systems in both academic research and organisational application can be attributed to their transformative capabilities that extend far beyond traditional automation. These autonomous AI agents can independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, learn from experience, and execute multi-step actions without continuous human oversight (Negnevitsky, 2025). This high degree of autonomy, adaptability, and real-time reasoning enables them to effectively automate complex, dynamic, and often ambiguous real-world tasks, leading to significant improvements in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability across diverse sectors such as healthcare, finance, logistics, and scientific discovery (Negnevitsky, 2025). Each agent within these systems is designed with specific attributes and follows rules that dictate its behavioural mechanisms, enabling it to dynamically react to its environment and refine its operations over time (Waldherr et al., 2021). The system's overall behaviour, or "macro phenomena," thus emerges from these individual "micro processes" and their interactions, rather than being explicitly programmed (Waldherr et al., 2021). This bottom-up, emergent approach stands in sharp contrast to traditional statistical methods, which often rely on assumptions like the independence of units or linear relationships, and frequently prove inadequate for analysing complex, interconnected systems with nonlinear dynamics (Waldherr et al., 2021).
The capabilities of autonomous AI agents, translate into tangible benefits for organisations. By capitalising on their ability to independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, and execute multi-step actions, organisations can achieve levels of operational efficiency and automation in tasks that were previously too complex or dynamic for traditional systems. Key applications include simulating flows like traffic and crowd evacuation, analysing market dynamics such as stock markets and e-commerce, modelling organisational behaviour for risk management and design, and understanding diffusion processes in social networks (Bonabeau, 2002)

**Discussion 1 Summary Post**

Our discussion began by highlighting how the transformative power of agent-based systems stems from their unique ability to have autonomous agents that can independently perceive complex environments, make context-aware decisions, learn from experience, and execute multi-step actions without continuous human oversight (Negnevitsky, 2025). We established that their bottom-up, emergent behaviour, where complex "macro phenomena" arise from simple "micro-level" agent interactions, stands in sharp contrast to traditional statistical methods that are often inadequate for analysing complex systems with non-linear dynamics (Waldherr et al., 2021).

Elias provided a compelling extension to this, linking these capabilities directly to organisational resilience, particularly in environments with high uncertainty. He noted that the decentralised nature of these systems allows them to adapt to disruptions without the bottlenecks of centralised control, a concept supported by Jennings and Bussmann (2003). He used an example of supply chain logistics, suggesting how agents could "adjust routes or priorities on the fly when unexpected events occur," a capability that could be used in places like Amazon warehouses to increase profitability and reduce manual labour. Furthermore, he reinforced the importance of learning mechanisms, which allow agents to improve over time and deliver long-term gains that "static rule-based agents cannot match."

While we focused on the benefits, Mohamed raised the important issue of managing the vulnerabilities inherent in these emergent systems. He correctly pointed out that the very unpredictability that makes them powerful necessitates robust governance. To achieve this, he proposed a framework for responsible deployment. He began by advocating for robust simulation testing under extreme and edge-case conditions to expose vulnerabilities in agent interactions before they can cause real-world harm. Furthermore, he emphasised the need for multi-layered, human-in-the-loop fail-safes where operators can "pause, override, or reconfigure agents" to maintain essential control in critical domains like public safety. Building on this, he highlighted the importance of continuous monitoring, since adapting agents require ongoing analysis of both micro-level behaviours and macro-level system outcomes to enable early detection of undesirable patterns like "coordination failures or harmful emergent dynamics." Finally, he called for creating auditability standards to ensure that system inputs, decision logic, and interactions can be traced, a measure that supports both troubleshooting and regulatory compliance.

### Unit 5-7 Collaborative Discussion 2: Agent Communication Languages

**Discussion 2 Initial post**

Agent Communication Languages represent a sophisticated approach to inter-agent communication, distinguishing themselves from lower-level APIs by encoding "speech acts" such as "tell," "ask," or "achieve." This design often separates the transport layer, content language, and ontology, enabling multiple agents to negotiate, advertise capabilities, request services, and coordinate their actions in a declarative manner (Mayfield, Labrou, & Finin, 1996).

A primary advantage of using an ACL like KQML is its high level of abstraction and inherent platform independence. This architecture allows for seamless interoperability among agents developed using different programming languages and operating on different platforms, provided they adhere to the specified ACL protocols (Kone, Shimazu & Nakajima, 2000). This flexibility is particularly valuable in open, evolving environments where participants might not have been initially designed to collaborate.

However, ACLs also bring disadvantages. First, they are complex: to interpret a message correctly, agents often need to share a common ontology. Without this, messages could be misunderstood. Second, KQML and similar ACLs historically lacked fully formalised rules for how each performative should be interpreted, which sometimes caused different implementations to behave inconsistently. Finally, parsing and interpreting ACL messages takes more computing time than a straightforward function call, which can be a disadvantage when efficiency is critical. (Labrou, Finin & Peng,1999)

In contrast, method invocation in programming languages such as Python or Java is much simpler. The benefits are speed, clarity, and strong guarantees about the structure of inputs and outputs. But these calls are tightly coupled: both sides must know the same method definitions, interfaces, and data structures in advance. They are less flexible than ACLs when working in open, evolving environments where participants may not have been designed to cooperate.

**Discussion 3 Summary Post**

In my initial post, I aimed to frame the debate around what I see as a central design choice in multi-agent systems: the trade-off between the high-level, declarative flexibility of Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) and the efficient, tightly coupled nature of direct method invocation. I highlighted the key challenges that often make developers hesitant to adopt ACLs, namely the need for shared ontologies (a common dictionary), the risk of semantic ambiguity where messages can be misinterpreted, and the performance overhead compared to simple function calls.

Pëllumb, your response directly addressed the most critical of these issues, ontology dependence, which I'm glad you focused on. You provided a compelling, modern perspective that suggests we are no longer constrained by the old limitations. By presenting solutions like dynamic ontology negotiation and the emerging use of Large Language Models for real-time semantic alignment, you rightly showed that this isn't a static problem. This suggests a promising path to overcoming one of the most significant barriers to ACL adoption, allowing agents to effectively communicate in truly open and heterogeneous environments where pre-agreed standards are impossible.

Abdullah, you then grounded the discussion perfectly with a set of practical, engineering-focused strategies to mitigate the very failure modes I outlined. Your recommendations provide a tangible roadmap for building robust and reliable systems. For instance, creating a "message cookbook" and codifying conversation protocols directly tackles the ambiguity I mentioned, while using a directory for capability discovery helps agents operate with more certainty. I found your idea of a hybrid system especially smart. Using the flexible ACL for general coordination and command but switching to a faster, direct connection for sending large amounts of data is an elegant solution. It directly resolves the performance tension I initially raised, effectively giving us the best of both worlds.

Ultimately, your contributions have beautifully demonstrated that the choice is not as drastic as I first presented it. By combining the disciplined architectural patterns Abdullah described with the advanced, adaptive techniques Pëllumb highlighted, we can engineer systems that are both flexible and efficient, overcoming the classic limitations of ACLs.

### Unit 6

In Unit the task was to create an agent dialogue, using KQML and KIF, between two agents (named Alice and Bob).

Alice is an agent designed to procure stock and Bob is an agent that controls the stock levels for a warehouse. This dialogue should see Alice asking Bob about the available stock of 50 inch televisions, and also querying the number of HDMI slots the televisions have.

Alice initiates the conversation by sending an ask-all performative. This signals that she is expecting a complete list of all instances that satisfy the condition in the content. The KIF expression asks for all entities ?t that are a tv with a size of 50 inches, and it requests the stock-level (?level) for each of them.

```KQML
(ask-all
  :sender Alice
  :receiver Bob
  :language KIF
  :ontology warehouse-stock
  :reply-with q1
  :content (and
              (tv ?t)
              (size ?t 50-inch)
              (stock-level ?t ?level))
)
```
Bob processes the query and responds with a tell performative. The content of the message is a KIF expression containing a set of facts. Each fact links a specific television model (e.g., model-xyz-100) to its stock level. This response provides Alice with a comprehensive list of all the 50-inch televisions available in the warehouse.
```KQML
(tell
  :sender Bob
  :receiver Alice
  :language KIF
  :ontology warehouse-stock
  :in-reply-to q1
  :content (set
              (and (tv model-xyz-100) (size model-xyz-100 50-inch) (stock-level model-xyz-100 85))
              (and (tv model-abc-200) (size model-abc-200 50-inch) (stock-level model-abc-200 65)))
)
```

Now that Alice has the model numbers and stock levels, she sends another ask-all query to get more detailed product specifications. This time, the KIF content asks for the hdmi-slots for each of the specific television models (model-xyz-100 and model-abc-200) that Bob previously mentioned.
```KQML
(ask-all
  :sender Alice
  :receiver Bob
  :language KIF
  :ontology product-features
  :reply-with q2
  :content (and
              (or (= ?t model-xyz-100) (= ?t model-abc-200))
              (hdmi-slots ?t ?slots))
)
```
Bob responds with a final tell performative, providing the specific feature information Alice requested. The KIF content explicitly states the number of HDMI slots for both model-xyz-100 and model-abc-200.
```KQML
(tell
  :sender Bob
  :receiver Alice
  :language KIF
  :ontology product-features
  :in-reply-to q2
  :content (set
              (and (tv model-xyz-100) (hdmi-slots model-xyz-100 4))
              (and (tv model-abc-200) (hdmi-slots model-abc-200 3)))
)
```
### Unit 8

This exercise displays my understanding of computational linguistics by creating constituency-based parse trees for several sentences. It highlights my ability to analyse grammatical structure and, to identify and formally represent syntactic ambiguity, a challenge in Natural Language Processing.

The government raised interest rates.
```Parse_Tree
(S
  (NP
    (Det The)
    (N government))
  (VP
    (V raised)
    (NP
      (N interest)
      (N rates)))
  (. .))
```


The internet gives everyone a voice.
```Parse_Tree
(S
  (NP
    (Det The)
    (N internet))
  (VP
    (V gives)
    (NP (Pro everyone))
    (NP
      (Det a)
      (N voice)))
  (. .))
```
The man saw the dog with the telescope.
```Parse_Tree

  (NP
    (Det The)
    (N man))
  (VP
    (V saw)
    (NP
      (Det the)
      (N dog))
    (PP
      (P with)
      (NP
        (Det the)
        (N telescope))))
  (. .))
```
### Unit 9-11 Collaborative Discussion 3: Deep learning

**Discussion 3 Initial Post**
Generative AI systems such as large language models and other sophisticated deep learning tools, while providing immense beneficial applications, drastically lower the barrier for malicious actors to operate at an unprecedented scale and efficacy.

First, these models are trained on massive, scraped corpora, often without meaningful consent or provenance, and can reproduce historical biases and exclusions. Opaque dataset practices therefore create representational harms that disproportionately affect marginalised groups. Such failures can reproduce discriminatory outcomes and sometimes regurgitate copyrighted material, amplifying legal concerns (Bender et al., 2021)

Second, generative outputs unsettle authorship, attribution, and remuneration. Legal scholarship argues that non-human or minimally human-directed productions challenge copyright doctrines, and policy bodies now require applicants to identify human contributions when registering AI-assisted works, producing legal and economic uncertainty for creators and markets. Courts and agencies are actively grappling with these boundaries and the fundamental definitions of originality (Gervais, 2020).

Furthermore, the technology poses a grave threat to political security and the integrity of public discourse. Generative AI can automate the production of disinformation, specifically leading to fake news reports with fabricated video and audio (known as "deepfakes"). This capability challenges the traditional trust placed in multimedia evidence, the "seeing is believing" aspect, and makes it easier to conduct hyper-personalised disinformation campaigns to sway public opinion or suppress truthful debate. Because AI-enabled attacks are expected to be especially effective, finely targeted, and difficult to attribute, they risk eroding societal trust and potentially strengthening the hand of authoritarian regimes (Brundage et al., 2018).

In conclusion, generative deep learning presents documented ethical risks across representational, legal, and societal dimensions. Addressing them requires multi-stakeholder governance: transparent data practices, updated intellectual property and labour policies, robust detection and literacy programmes, pilot licensing schemes, and public funding for oversight to guide this rapidly evolving field.

**Discussion 3 Summary Post**

This discussion focused on the practical and ethical problems that come with generative AI systems. In my initial post, I highlighted three main concerns: biased training data that harms marginalised groups, messy legal questions about who owns AI-generated content, and the serious threat of deepfakes undermining trust in what we see and hear online.

Abdulla's response was helpful in suggesting the Responsible Innovation framework as a way to tackle these issues systematically. The four principles: anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness, offer a practical structure for thinking about how we develop and regulate these technologies before problems spiral out of control.

Looking back at the last three units, we covered the technical side of how deep learning works. We learned more about Industry 4.0 and how AI is being integrated different economic sectors, explored real-world applications of deep learning, and studied artificial neural networks and their architectures. Understanding these foundations makes it clear that the technology itself is powerful and versatile, but that same power creates risks when datasets are scraped without consent or when bad actors exploit these tools.

What strikes me most is that technical fixes alone won't solve these problems. Better algorithms can't address fundamental issues around bias, copyright, or malicious use. We need updated policies, better oversight, and stronger detection tools working alongside the technology itself.

The multi-stakeholder approach I mentioned needs to be practical, not just theoretical. This means clear rules about where training data comes from, updated copyright laws that make sense for AI-generated work, investment in tools that can spot deepfakes, and regulatory bodies that can actually keep pace with how fast this field moves.

On Abdulla's question about global versus national governance: I think we need both. Some baseline international standards would help, especially for cross-border issues like disinformation campaigns, but individual countries also need flexibility to adapt regulations to their specific contexts and move quickly when needed.

### Unit 10: Deep Learning in Action
Deepfake and synthetic-media technology, deep learning systems that generate or alter realistic audio, images and video to make people appear to say or do things they never did, is rapidly reshaping how we trust digital media. Recent industry and academic analyses show generative models now produce convincing voice clones and photoreal video in minutes, and use continues to accelerate across fraud, entertainment and politics (Maslej et al., 2025)

At a high level these systems use deep generative models (originally GANs, now often diffusion models and specialised neural vocoders) trained on large datasets of images, video and speech. They learn statistical mappings that let the model synthesise a target face, mimic an accent or re-render a speaker’s lip movement to match new audio. Audio cloning can require only seconds of recording; video synthesis combines frame-level generation with temporal models and face-warping to preserve motion and expression. Detection methods are themselves deep-learning models but face the “arms race” problem as generators improve (Amerini et al., 2025)

The proliferation of deepfake technology has already manifested in concerning real-world applications across multiple domains. Financial fraud schemes increasingly exploit voice-cloned phone calls to impersonate executives and authorise fraudulent transfers, while political disinformation campaigns have deployed synthetic videos during election cycles to manipulate public opinion. In the entertainment industry, actors and content creators face unauthorised digital reproduction of their likenesses, raising questions about consent and intellectual property. Meanwhile, non-consensual intimate imagery remains one of the most harmful applications, disproportionately targeting women and causing severe reputational and psychological damage (Romero-Moreno, 2025). These use cases underscore the urgent need for technical and regulatory intervention, as the barrier to entry continues to fall while the potential for harm scales exponentially.

Ethics and policy responses must balance free expression, consent and accountability: better provenance standards, watermarking, legal protections for likeness and stronger detection tools are all being proposed by researchers and regulators. Because the technology both stores traces of real people and scales deception, societies will need coordinated technical, legal and educational responses to preserve trust while enabling legitimate innovation (Spivack, 2024)

## Reflective Piece: What Have I Learned and How?

This module has fundamentally changed how I think about agent-based systems, taking me from theory to actual implementation. Through discussions, exercises, and both group and solo projects, I've developed technical skills in agent-based computing while learning about the ethical side of agent-based systems. This reflection uses Rolfe et al.'s (2001) framework to explore what happened, why it mattered, and how I'll use what I learned.

### What: Module Experience and Project Development

The module built up concepts progressively. Discussion 1 covered agent-based systems and emergent properties, establishing the theoretical foundation. The collaborative discussions were valuable because they forced me to explore complex ideas while learning from others. Elias and Mohamed brought perspectives on system resilience and governance that I hadn't considered.

Discussion 2 focused on Agent Communication Languages. Creating the KQML/KIF dialogue in Unit 6 between Alice and Bob made abstract concepts concrete. I learned that designing effective agent communication requires careful consideration about ontologies, performatives, and potential ambiguities. The discussion with Pëllumb and Abdullah showed how modern solutions like dynamic ontology negotiation could solve the problems I'd identified.

The group project to design a Multi-Agent System for automating literature reviews was challenging. Coordinating schedules across time zones required extensive planning. I started recording all meetings, which became essential for keeping absent team members informed. This reflected my growing understanding that the extent in which documentation matters in distributed software development.

Discussion 3 shifted the focus to Natural Language Processing. Building parse trees in Unit 8 helped me understand syntactic ambiguity in Natural Language Processing. The deep learning discussions highlighted serious ethical challenges with generative AI.

The solo implementation project brought everything together. Translating our group's design into working code using the BDI model required concrete architectural decisions. Implementing specialised agents to perform concurrent search across sources, integrating APIs for metadata extraction, and ensuring robust error handling taught me that design on paper differs significantly from actual implementation.

### So What: Analysis and Emotional Response

Working through this module triggered different emotional responses as I engaged more deeply with the material. Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the range of topics, from formal logic and communication protocols to neural networks and ethics. The theoretical density of early units, particularly around BDI models, challenged how I thought about software systems.

The group project brought both frustration and satisfaction. Coordinating design decisions asynchronously was difficult. I sometimes felt my contributions weren't fully understood or that consensus formed without proper consideration of alternatives. Recording meetings helped but ensuring everyone stayed aligned required significant effort. However, seeing our design proposal come together with clear requirements, architectural diagrams, and a comprehensive test plan generated genuine pride.

The solo implementation shifted things dramatically. Initially, I felt confident because we had a detailed design. Reality corrected that quickly. The anxiety I felt when implementations failed, particularly when web searches timed out or the extraction agent incorrectly parsed PDFs, was initially demotivating. However, this anxiety became productive once I reframed it. Each failure revealed an implicit assumption in our design: that network requests would complete reliably, that PDFs would follow consistent formatting standards, that APIs would remain accessible. Building robust error handling, implementing exponential backoff for retries, and graceful degradation when sources were unavailable, taught me that production systems must be designed with failure as the expected case, not the exception.

The ethical discussions, particularly around deepfakes and generative AI, were sobering. Bender et al.'s (2021) "Stochastic Parrots" paper and Brundage et al.'s (2018) analysis of AI's malicious use made me confront an uncomfortable truth. The technologies I'm learning to build have the potential to cause real harm. The documented cases of deepfake fraud and non-consensual intimate imagery represent genuine suffering.

### Now What: Future Application

This module has given me technical skills and ethical frameworks I'll use in future work. The BDI model provides a useful way to break complex problems into autonomous components. In professional contexts, I can apply this to business process automation, where different agents handle discrete workflow stages like document processing, validation, routing, and storage, communicating through a central blackboard.The experience with concurrent programming and API integration is immediately useful. The exponential backoff retry mechanism for handling API failures is a pattern I'll reuse when working with external services.

However, my most significant learning concerns ethics. The governance framework I proposed in my deepfakes analysis, combining simulation testing, human-in-the-loop fail-safes, continuous monitoring, and auditability standards, is a practical template I'll apply. When developing systems that impact people, technical correctness isn't enough. Systems must be transparent, auditable, and designed with failure modes explicitly considered.

Recording group meetings, which I initially did for practical reasons, has become permanent practice. Documentation isn't overhead, it's essential for collaboration and knowledge transfer. Effective teamwork requires explicit communication protocols, just as agent systems require formal communication languages.

Moving forward, I'm committed to specific actions. When facing complex automation problems, I'll explicitly consider whether an agent-based architecture is appropriate, evaluating modularity, autonomy, and coordination requirements. I'll approach AI capabilities with scepticism about societal implications, actively considering how systems might be misused or cause unintended harm.

This module has changed my understanding of what it means to build intelligent systems. It's not just about autonomous agents or algorithms, it's about creating systems that are technically sound, ethically responsible, and genuinely useful for solving real problems.
