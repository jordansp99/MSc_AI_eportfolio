Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing our world. This module provides a foundational understanding of AI, its subfields, benefits, challenges, and ethical implications.

## What is AI?

AI is the ability of computers to mimic human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  While often imagined as sentient robots, AI is currently more focused on specific tasks.

## Key Concepts

* **Machine Learning (ML):** Computers learning from data without explicit programming (e.g., spam filters).
* **Deep Learning (DL):** ML using complex neural networks (e.g., image recognition).
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Enabling computers to understand and generate language (e.g., chatbots).
* **Computer Vision:** Enabling computers to "see" and interpret images (e.g., facial recognition).
* **Robotics:** Combining AI with engineering to create autonomous robots.

## Benefits

AI offers numerous potential benefits:

* Increased efficiency and productivity.
* Improved healthcare.
* Enhanced education.
* Solving complex problems.

## Challenges

AI also presents challenges:

* Job displacement.
* Bias and fairness.
* Privacy concerns.
* Autonomous weapons.

## Example: Linear Regression (Python)

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

X_new = np.array([[6]])
y_pred = model.predict(X_new)

plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.plot(X, model.predict(X), color='red')
plt.scatter(X_new, y_pred, color='green')
plt.show()

print(f"Prediction for X = 6: {y_pred[0]}")
